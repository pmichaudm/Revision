                "CPU", "Job scheduling is the process of allocating system resources to many different tasks by an operating system (OS). \nThe system handles prioritized job queues that are awaiting CPU time and it should determine which job to be taken from which queue and the amount of time to be allocated for the job. This type of scheduling makes sure that all jobs are carried out fairly and on time.\n",

There is a master processor that gives instruction to all the other processors.\n Asymmetric multiprocessor system contains a master slave relationship. Asymmetric multiprocessor was the only type of multiprocessor available before symmetric multiprocessors were created. Now also, this is the cheaper option.\n",
